# Running Resources

Crossplane enables you to run a number of different resources in a portable and cloud agnostic way, allowing you to author an application that runs without modifications on multiple environments and cloud providers.
A single Crossplane enables the provisioning and full-lifecycle management of infrastructure across a wide range of providers, vendors, regions, and offerings.

## Running Databases

## Running Kubernetes Clusters

## Future support

As the project continues to grow with support from the community, support for more resources will be added.
This includes all of the essential managed services from cloud providers as well as local or in-cluster services that deploy using the operator pattern.
Crossplane will provide support for serverless, databases, object storage (buckets), analytics, big data, AI, ML, message queues, key-value stores, and more.
